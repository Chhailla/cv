            <ul>
                <li>Well whatever a person sees or faces, it leaves a great impact on what he learns and decisions he makes. </li>
                <li>When time came I chose to become a government servant and today I'm in government service for which I have prepared very hard.</li>
                <li>But after entering in this service, I found that this is not the profile which I can do for rest of my life.</li>
                <li>So, I've started exploring new career options that may give me pleasure and be beneficial for me as well as for my family's future.</li>
                <li>Rightnow I can see two career options. The first one is to reach to a higher post through UPSC exam and another one is to switch to a completely new career line i.e. private sector and become a software engineer.</li>
